Guides, documentation, and all things webpack.


## Content Progress

Now that we've covered much of the backlog of _missing documentation_, we are starting
to heavily review each section of the site's content to sort and structure it appropriately.
The following issues should provide a pretty good idea of where things are, and where
they are going:

- [Guides - Review and Simplify][1]
- [Concepts - Review, Organize, Define Clear Goals][2]

We haven't created issues for the other sections yet but they will be coming soon. For
dev-related work please see [General - Current Longterm Plan][3], which will soon be
replaced by a more dev-specific issue.


## Translation

If you hope to localize this documentation please jump to the [translate branch][4].
